# Agent Container Instructions

## Environment

You are running inside a **Docker container (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)**. You are the non-root user `agent` with passwordless `sudo`. The shell is `bash`. Do **not** assume anything about the host operating system — check `/etc/container-runtime-info.md` (see next section) to learn what it is.

## Host & Mount Info

Details about the host machine and the directories mounted into this container are written at **`/etc/container-runtime-info.md`**. This file is regenerated every time the container is launched. Read it when you need to know:

- What OS/arch the host is running
- Which host paths are mounted into the container and where
- Your primary working directory

## Preinstalled Tools

This image ships with the following so you do not need to install them yourself:

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| AI CLIs | `claude` (Claude Code), `codex` (OpenAI Codex), `@larksuite/cli` |
| VCS | `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI) |
| Container | `docker` CLI (talks to the host Docker daemon via mounted socket) |
| Node.js | Node 22 LTS + `npm`, `npx` |
| Python | `python3`, `pip`, `pipx`, `uv` |
| Python apps | `crawl4ai` (with Playwright Chromium), `markitdown[pptx]` |
| Office/PDF | `libreoffice-impress`, `poppler-utils` (pdftoppm, pdftotext, …) |
| Diagrams | `drawio` Desktop + `xvfb`/`xvfb-run` for headless export |
| Shell / editors | `bash`, `tmux`, `vim`, `nano` |
| Search / JSON | `ripgrep` (`rg`), `jq` |
| Net / archive | `curl`, `wget`, `zip`, `unzip`, `openssh-client` |
| Build | `build-essential`, `make` |

Useful aliases (from `~/.bashrc`):

- `venv-check` → reports `.venv` / `.linux_venv` state in the current dir

## Network

The container uses **bridge mode** networking. Do not use `localhost` to reach services on the host machine — it will only resolve to the container itself.

To reach a service running on the host, use:
```
host.docker.internal:<port>
```

Examples:
- PostgreSQL on the host: `host.docker.internal:5432`
- A local web server: `host.docker.internal:8080`

This works on Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) out of the box. On native Linux Docker it only resolves if the container was started with `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` — check `/etc/container-runtime-info.md` for the host OS, and fall back to the host's actual IP if needed.

## Python Virtual Environments

The environment variable `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.linux_venv` is set in this container.

When using `uv`, virtual environments are created in `.linux_venv` instead of the default `.venv`. Always use `.linux_venv` when referencing or activating the virtual environment:

```bash
source .linux_venv/bin/activate
```

### Why `.linux_venv` instead of `.venv`

Projects mounted from the host may already contain a `.venv` directory built for the host's OS/arch (e.g. darwin/arm64 if the host is a Mac). Those binaries are **incompatible** with this Linux container and must not be used. Check `/etc/container-runtime-info.md` to see the host's OS and arch.

Key rules:
- **Never activate or use `.venv`** — if it exists, it was built for the host and will not run here.
- **Always use `.linux_venv`** for any Python work inside the container.
- If a tool or script hardcodes `.venv` (e.g. `source .venv/bin/activate`), replace or override with `.linux_venv`.
- When checking whether a venv is healthy, verify the platform: `python -c "import platform; print(platform.system())"` should print `Linux`.
- `uv sync`, `uv run`, and `uv pip` all respect `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` automatically — prefer them over manual venv activation.

## draw.io Export

draw.io Desktop is installed and can export `.drawio` files from the terminal. It requires a virtual X display — `--headless` alone is not sufficient in this container.

**Always use `xvfb-run`:**

```bash
# Export to PNG
xvfb-run -a drawio --no-sandbox -x -f png your-file.drawio

# Export to PNG and embed the original diagram XML
xvfb-run -a drawio --no-sandbox -x -f png -e your-file.drawio
```

Key rules:
- Do **not** pass extra Chromium flags (e.g. `--disable-gpu`) — the CLI parser may treat them as the input path and fail with `Error: input file/directory not found`.
- `drawio-mcp`'s `mcp-tool-server` does **not** export to PNG; it only opens/loads diagrams in the editor. Use the Desktop CLI above for image export.
- `xvfb-run` and `Xvfb` are already installed at `/usr/bin/`.
